PN2 Build Instructions:

For PN2 to work correctly, check that these are satisfied:

WTL:
====

PN2 uses the Windows Template Library, make sure you have this!
If you don't know what it is, or don't have it, see:

http://www.pnotepad.org/articles/wtljoys.html

Expat:
======

PN2 currently requires a separate expat download:
http://expat.sourceforge.net/

PN uses the .lib and .dll files built by the expat 
workspace available from this website. If you download the
win32 binary .exe file it contains these ready built.

In the pn2 (or pnwtl) /lib directory you must have:
libexpat.lib
and / or 
libexpatw.lib (unicode).
	
In the pn2/bin directory, you must have:
libexpat.dll
and / or
libexpatw.dll (unicode)

Additional Notes:
=================

SchemeConfig.cpp has a function which works only with the ATL in VC7. This will need fixing to provide a VC6 version too, although I'm not too worried for now. For now, it is #ifdefd away.

Good Luck!
