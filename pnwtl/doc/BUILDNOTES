PN2 Build Instructions:

PN2 can only be built using Microsoft Visual C++ 2003+ at the moment.

For PN2 to work correctly, check that these are satisfied:

WTL:
====

PN2 uses the Windows Template Library, make sure you have this!
If you don't know what it is, or don't have it, see:

http://www.pnotepad.org/articles/wtljoys.html

Get WTL from:

http://wtl.sf.net/

You will also probably need to install the Microsoft Platform SDK.

Expat:
======

PN2 source has pre-compiled expat binaries.

PCRE:
=====

PN2 source has pre-compiled PCRE libs.

Boost:
======

PN2 requires that you have boost installed and configured in your VC include directories.

Additional Notes:
=================

SchemeConfig.cpp has a function which works only with the ATL in VC7. 
This will need fixing to provide a VC6 version too, although I'm not 
too worried for now. For now, it is #ifdefd away.

Due to the extensive use of templates in PN2, VC6 can have problems 
with its stack size - you need to allow it to use more space which is 
probably in project options or something. You could also try using the 
latest VC6 service pack.

Good Luck!
