PN2 Build Instructions:

Requirements:
=============

PN2 can only be built using Microsoft Visual C++ 2003+ at the moment.

For PN2 to work correctly, check that these are satisfied:

WTL:
====

PN2 uses the Windows Template Library, make sure you have this!
If you don't know what it is, or don't have it, see:

Get WTL from:

You will also probably need to install the Microsoft Platform SDK.

Boost:
======

PN2 requires that you have boost installed and configured in your VC include directories.

Good Luck!
