PN2 Build Instructions:

PN2 can only be built using Microsoft Visual C++ at the moment.

For PN2 to work correctly, check that these are satisfied:

WTL:
====

PN2 uses the Windows Template Library, make sure you have this!
If you don't know what it is, or don't have it, see:

http://www.pnotepad.org/articles/wtljoys.html

You will also probably need to install the Microsoft Platform SDK.

Expat:
======

PN2 currently requires a separate expat download:
http://expat.sourceforge.net/

PN uses the .lib and .dll files built by the expat 
workspace available from this website. If you download the
win32 binary .exe file it contains these ready built.

In the pn2 (or pnwtl) /lib directory you must have:
libexpat.lib
and / or 
libexpatw.lib (unicode).
	
In the pn2/bin directory, you must have:
libexpat.dll
and / or
libexpatw.dll (unicode)

PCRE:
=====

PN2 currently requires a separate PCRE download:
http://pcre.sourceforge.net/

PN uses PCRE (by default) as a static lib. You need to manually configure
PCRE to build a static lib called libpcre.lib. We define SUPPORT_UTF8 when
building.

In the pn2 /lib directory you must have:
libpcre.lib

We will release a VC7 project or NAnt buildfile to build the lib in the future.

Additional Notes:
=================

SchemeConfig.cpp has a function which works only with the ATL in VC7. 
This will need fixing to provide a VC6 version too, although I'm not 
too worried for now. For now, it is #ifdefd away.

Due to the extensive use of templates in PN2, VC6 can have problems 
with its stack size - you need to allow it to use more space which is 
probably in project options or something. You could also try using the 
latest VC6 service pack.

Good Luck!
