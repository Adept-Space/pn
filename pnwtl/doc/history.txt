What's new?
-----------

1) Groups of scheme settings can now be configured using their style group head item.

example: To change the background for all PHP styles, simply change the background
on the main PHP item that contains the styles below it. This will not override any
custom backgrounds already set on those items - those will need to be reset.

Define your own schemes using simple XML - can support a large number of languages. 
See the included vhdl.schemedef sample. There will be documentation for this soon.

4) Output parsing for user-defined output strings.

Release Name: 2.0.1-poptart
Build: 2.0.1.32, Version Label: poptart
=======================================

This is the first release of Programmers Notepad 2. Obviously there are a limited number of features at the moment.

Please don't moan about the following, they are all quite obvious to us already:

1) No options dialog.
2) Missing schemes from pn1.
3) No options dialog (incase you missed it above).
4) No project management.
5) No tools.
6) No printing.
7) Toolbars aren't dockable.
8) You can't turn the tabs off.

So what is good?

1) New editing engine (The excellent Scintilla: http://www.scintilla.org/).
2) Now written in C++ using the Windows Template Library.
3) Fast. Really Fast - compare opening times for large files with PN1.
4) Two (count-em!) toolbars. Obviously this sort of stuff will get better as time goes on.
5) Lovely XP-Style tabs.
6) Save-As dialog contains a "File Format" feature.
7) Support for C++, HTML, XML and Object Pascal. More schemes coming soon.
8) Highly configurable XML backend for scheme configuration, config dialog coming to a release near you soon.
9) The minibar from pn1 is here (see at the bottom of the edit windows).
10) Scoping / Folding / Outlining (Open a C++ or Pascal file to see this, it's lovely).
