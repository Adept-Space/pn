Known things:
-------------

Please don't moan about the following, they are all quite obvious to us already:

1) Missing schemes from pn1.
2) No project management.
3) Toolbars aren't dockable.
4) You can't turn the tabs off.
5) PN needs a "Monospaced Font" mode.

So what is good?
----------------

1) New editing engine (The excellent Scintilla: http://www.scintilla.org/).
2) Now written in C++ using the Windows Template Library.
3) Fast. Really Fast - compare opening times for large files with PN1.
4) Two (count-em!) toolbars. Obviously this sort of stuff will get better as time goes on.
5) Lovely XP-Style tabs.
6) Save-As dialog contains a "File Format" feature.
7) Support for C++, HTML, XML and Object Pascal. More schemes coming soon.
8) Highly configurable XML backend for scheme configuration.
9) The minibar from pn1 is here (see at the bottom of the edit windows).
10) Scoping / Folding / Outlining (Open a C++, Pascal or Java file to see this, it's lovely).
11) Word-wrap.
12) Schemes configuration.
13) Tools with output capturing, running in a separate thread. Much better than PN1.
