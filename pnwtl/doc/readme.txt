======================================

This is the second release of Programmers Notepad 2.

What's new?
-----------

1) Options dialog.
2) Printing support.
3) Less bugs.
4) Configurable schemes (through options dialog).
5) Python Scheme

Printing note: This feature is experimental, and we have experienced the odd problem after printing. Please experiment and let us know how you get on.

Config note: There are probably bugs with these features, please let us know if you find any. You can help by providing us with a copy of the file:
%usersettings%\Echo Software\Programmers Notepad\UserSettings.xml

Known things:
-------------

Please don't moan about the following, they are all quite obvious to us already:

1) Missing schemes from pn1.
2) No project management.
3) No tools.
4) Toolbars aren't dockable.
5) You can't turn the tabs off.
6) CSS Scheme isn't implemented properly.

So what is good?
----------------

1) New editing engine (The excellent Scintilla: http://www.scintilla.org/).
2) Now written in C++ using the Windows Template Library.
3) Fast. Really Fast - compare opening times for large files with PN1.
4) Two (count-em!) toolbars. Obviously this sort of stuff will get better as time goes on.
5) Lovely XP-Style tabs.
6) Save-As dialog contains a "File Format" feature.
7) Support for C++, HTML, XML and Object Pascal. More schemes coming soon.
8) Highly configurable XML backend for scheme configuration.
9) The minibar from pn1 is here (see at the bottom of the edit windows).
10) Scoping / Folding / Outlining (Open a C++ or Pascal file to see this, it's lovely).
11) Word-wrap.
