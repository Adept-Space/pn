| Working towards 0.5 :: Mingus
---------------------------------------

Since 18/11/03:

Added encoding conversions to text-clip imports. Text clips must be saved as
UTF-8, UTF-16 or iso-8859-1 text, but come into PN2 as UTF-8. Due to this,
some characters could not be shown previously, but can now be converted to 
ANSI or Windows-1252 (just about iso-8859-1 ) on import. This allows text-
clips to include characters in these encodings for insertion into documents.
To enable an encoding for a given clips file, simply include an encoding=""
attribute on the clips element, and specify one of "windows-1252" or "ansi".

The name of each clip is by default treated as UTF-8. If the title itself 
contains non-ASCII characters then PN will make an attempt at displaying 
anything that fits into windows-1252. To enable this, a clips element can 
specify decodeNames="true".

Fixed the text-clips chooser.
