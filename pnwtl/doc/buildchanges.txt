Icon file icons no longer cached.
Enabled multiple-selection in projects tree control.

Since 13/10/03:

Projects view sets correct icons when adding files, not just when loading a project.
Only asks you to close files in the workspace if there are workspace files open - not just any file.
Tooltip for Find in Files item.
Changed new folder text to "Add New Folder" to disabiguate from Add Files.
Rolled back mru text length changes - maximum now hard-coded to 97.
Status bar now shows filenames of files on the MRU list as the mouse moves over them.
