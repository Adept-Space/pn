Since 13/10/03:

Projects view sets correct icons when adding files, not just when loading a project.
Only asks you to close files in the workspace if there are workspace files open - not just any file.
Tooltip for Find in Files item.
Changed new folder text to "Add New Folder" to disabiguate from Add Files.
