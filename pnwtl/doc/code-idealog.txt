This file is meant to be a place to record ideas as they come to PN2 developers - so that they don't get lost. Every now and then, people can take a look through it, and see if there are any ideas they'd like to implement.

Scheme Disabling:

Probably need a way to disable the schemes one-by-one - some people 
don't want certain schemes and want an easy checkbox way to
disable them.

Ideas for optimisation:
	
After compiling schemes, write out a table of schemes linking scheme files to scheme names / titles. 
This saves examining all .cscheme files each time. It also gives
a good list of .cscheme files to delete before compilation or on
a cleanout.
