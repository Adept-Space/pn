PN2 RoadMap:

PN is attempting to keep to a minimum of one release every two months. 
The planned feature-implementation schedule can be seen below. This will
be modified as and when I see fit - so don't bet money on it or anything.

Work with SVN development branches (e.g. prototypes/big rewrites) are denoted with {branch-name}.
Work completed or in-progress is shown with [proportion-developer] or [complete-developer],
where no developer name is given it's Simon.
